## 🏗 Architecture & Patterns

The project follows an MVC-style separation:

- Models: `lib/database/*` — data classes (e.g. `MenuInfo`) and `fromJson` parsing
- Views: `lib/view/*` and `lib/widget/*` — UI screens and reusable components
- Controllers: `lib/controller/*` — Supabase/Firebase services and Provider controllers

State & navigation approach:

- Provider: single source of truth for shared app state (cart, user session)
- GetX (`get`): navigation helpers and lightweight UI utilities (snackbars, `Get.to`)

This mix keeps business logic testable (controllers) while keeping UI code in view layers.

## 🛠 Tech stack

- Flutter & Dart
- Supabase (`supabase_flutter`) for backend data and optional realtime
- Firebase (`firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`) — init code present
- Provider — state management
- GetX (`get`) — routing and UI helpers
- UI libs: `google_fonts`, `font_awesome_flutter`, `flutter_animate`, `avatar_glow`
